# python_pizza
This CLI app can be used to order pizza and select the size and extra toppings needed. It also saves to the DB.

The application asks for your name, greets you politely, and then proceeds to ask for your order details such as:
  1. Size of pepperoni
  2. If extra pepperoni is needed and size desired
  3. If extra cheese is needed (just one size)
The app calculates the cost and reverts to the user.


## Tasks
  1. Get users max points (also save all rows in a df after reading from DB)
  2. Let the user know when he is due to clear the bill with his points
  3. Get the admin page, first_name should be "admin". that would clear the screen and show a welcome to admin, then ask the user for a password.
  4. Get the users page with authentication, the users' table should have total points.


## Tables:
  1. Admin
  2. Users
  3. Products
