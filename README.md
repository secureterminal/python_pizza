# python_pizza
This CLI app can be used to order pizza and select the size and extra toppings needed. It also saves to the DB.

The application asks for your name, greets you politely, then proceeds to ask for your order details such as:
  1. Size of pepperoni
  2. If extra pepperoni is needed and size desired
  3. If extra cheese is needed (just one size)
The app calculates the cost and reverts to the user.
